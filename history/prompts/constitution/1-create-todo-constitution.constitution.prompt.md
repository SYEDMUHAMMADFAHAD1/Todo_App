## Prompt

```
Project: Evolution of Todo – Phase I (In-Memory Console App)

Goal:
Build an in-memory, console-based Todo application using strict Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. No manual coding is allowed.

Core Rules:
- Specs are the single source of truth
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- Any change requires spec updates, not code edits
- Follow clean, readable Python design

Scope:
- Python 3.13+
- Console (CLI) application
- In-memory storage only
- Single-user, single-process

Required Features:
- Add Task (title, optional description, auto ID)
- View Tasks (ID, title, status)
- Update Task (by ID)
- Delete Task (by ID)
- Toggle Complete / Incomplete

Data Constraints:
- Tasks exist only during runtime
- No file system or database usage
- Stable unique IDs per session

Project Structure:
- /src (main.py, task_manager.py)
- /specs and /specs/history
- sp.constitution.md
- README.md
- CLAUDE.md

Standards:
- Small, single-responsibility functions
- Clear naming, no overengineering
- Graceful handling of invalid input

Out of Scope:
- Persistence
- Web UI
- AI chatbot
- Cloud or Kubernetes

Success Criteria:
- All features work as specified
- Code fully generated via specs
- No manual code edits
- Clean console demo

Evaluation Focus:
- Spec quality
- Correct behavior
- Agentic development discipline
```

## Response snapshot

Created the constitution file for the Evolution of Todo project with the following principles:
1. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
2. In-Memory Console Application
3. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
4. Minimal Feature Implementation
5. Clean Architecture
6. Data Constraints

The constitution defines the core principles, project scope, development workflow, and governance for the project.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created project constitution that establishes Spec-Driven Development as the core methodology
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create spec for the Todo application features
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution properly establishes the non-negotiable rules for the project, especially the Spec-Driven Development approach.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create the spec file based on this constitution
