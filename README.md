# Evolution of Todo – Phase I (In-Memory Console App)

## Overview
This is a Python 3.13+ console-based Todo application built using strict Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. The project follows the principles defined in the project constitution.

## Project Principles
This project adheres to the following core principles as defined in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

1. **Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All code must be generated from specifications; No manual coding is allowed; Any change requires spec updates, not code edits
2. **In-Memory Console Application**: Python 3.13+ console (CLI) application only; In-memory storage only, no file system or database usage
3. **Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: TDD mandatory - tests written before implementation
4. **Clean Architecture**: Small, single-responsibility functions with clear naming
5. **Data Constraints**: Tasks exist only during runtime; No persistence to file system or database

## Project Structure
```
/specs              # Feature specifications, plans, and tasks
/src                # Source code (main.py, task_manager.py)
/.specify           # Spec-Kit Plus configuration and templates
/history            # Prompt History Records and ADRs
```

## Getting Started
1. All development starts with updating specifications in `/specs`
2. Implementation follows the Spec-Driven Development methodology
3. All code changes must comply with the project constitution

## Development Workflow
- Specs are the single source of truth
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- Follow clean, readable Python design
- Small, single-responsibility functions with clear naming
