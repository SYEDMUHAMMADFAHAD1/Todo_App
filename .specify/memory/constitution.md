# Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must be generated from specifications; No manual coding is allowed; Any change requires spec updates, not code edits; Follow clean, readable Python design
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### II. In-Memory Console Application
Python 3.13+ console (CLI) application only; In-memory storage only, no file system or database usage; Single-user, single-process design
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### IV. Minimal Feature Implementation
Focus areas requiring implementation: Add Task, View Tasks, Update Task, Delete Task, Toggle Complete/Incomplete; Stable unique IDs per session
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### V. Clean Architecture
Small, single-responsibility functions; Clear naming, no overengineering; Graceful handling of invalid input
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

### VI. Data Constraints

Tasks exist only during runtime; No persistence to file system or database; Stable unique IDs per session

## Project Scope
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

Console-based Todo application with Add, View, Update, Delete, and Toggle features; Python 3.13+, in-memory storage, single-user; Project structure: /src (main.py, task_manager.py), /specs and /specs/history
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## Development Workflow
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

Specs are the single source of truth; All code must be generated by Claude Code; Follow clean, readable Python design; Small, single-responsibility functions with clear naming
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

All code changes must comply with this constitution; Amendments require documentation and approval; Spec-Driven Development practices must be followed; All code must be generated via specs, no manual code edits
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
